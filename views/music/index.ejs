I'm incredibly excited about it, and it inspires me to continue to be more than just a viewer, but to continue in being a content creator, a contributor.</p>

          <p class="music-description">Almost a year after completing my senior project, I returned with two more videos on my music channel, this being the most popular of the two. I had a blast learning how to record audio and video and create these productions, it was a hobby that I certainly planned to continue post-high school. However I began taking a different direction--no longer producing for others, but now creating content for myself and showcasing my own independent abilities.</p>

          <p class="music-description">For my last video for my senior project, I mellowed out once more, introducing a slower, more calm, meaningful, and personal video with another classmate. Bringing to the table a more open and warming acoustic sound, paired with her smooth and clear tone, this last end product easily became the most polished audio and video.</p>

          <p class="music-description">Moving forward from my first attempt to make a music video, I wanted to try something a little more exciting, live, full of motion and action. Collaborating with my best bud, also a self-producing musician, he assisted in directing a production piece with a higher-energy feel for my second video.</p>

          <p class="music-description">In attending a middle college, all students were required to complete a <em>senior project</em>, for which I adopted a project involving original audio and video content creation. This was the very first music video I produced, with the help of a friend in high school. While it wasn't my first time experimenting with multi-tracking from the audio perspective, it was my first attempt at DSLR video recording and video post-production.</p>
